# C Data Structures
This my implementation for some data structures in C language.  
I enjoyed implementing these data structures while taking ["Data Structures"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures) course from Coursera.  
If you're new to the this subject, I recommend you to take this course as well.
